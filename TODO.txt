Fix recording error message

Watch for: It got stuck in state where only 4 of the 6 visible channels were scrolling as I navigated left / right. The other two remained static / stuck where they were.

When initially navigating to the Live TV screen from the main menu, no airing is displayed as focused (with white background). Itâ€™s not until navigating up/down/
right again that it would redraw with the focused appearance.
